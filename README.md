## Pac-Men 
### Description
- Generate and launch pac-men to bounce around your browser.
- The pac-men stay within the bounds of the browser window, which is accomplished through a basic colision-detection system.
- This system uses the inner width and height of the browser window to define "walls" to "bounce" the pac-men around the width and height of the window.
- JavaScript is used to move the pac-men by continually updating their coordinates. 
### Run Instructions
- Place contents of this repository on web server, or spin-up a development web server locally
- Navigate to the index.html page via browser
### Road Map
- Add more colission-detection to enable pac-men to:
  - Face the direction of their travel
  - Eat each other
  - Remove pac-men clicked by mouse-pointer

# pac-men

An MIT Exec Full-Stack Javascript Boot Camp Project

The Pac-Men Project was used to show the class how to setup a continuous updating of css to create a fluid motion across the screen, at different vectors and velocities.

Also, this was an introduction to the challenge of defining bounds and colissions between objects on the screen. In this exercise, the bounds are the left/right, and top/bottom of the visible wiindow, found using the built-in browser objectwindow to find window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight. The top is actually 50px to accomidate the NavBar.
